# 👋 Hey, we're Devolv

We’re building a collection of **open-source DevOps tools** — in public.

No buzzwords. Just useful tools, made with ❤️ and CLI flags.

## 🎯 Our Goal
Build a modular DevOps toolkit:
- 🛡️ IAM Policy Validator
- 📜 Permissions Boundary Generator
- 📦 Cookiecutter Infra Templates
- 🔐 Secrets & Security Tools

---

## 🛠️ Why Devolv?

We believe DevOps tools should be:
- Simple enough to read in a weekend
- Powerful enough to scale in production
- Open enough to trust

🧱 **We’re building live.**
